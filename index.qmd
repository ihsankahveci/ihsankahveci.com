### About Me

I am a doctoral candidate in Sociology at the University of Washington, specializing in innovative survey methodologies, demographic research. My work focuses on developing novel sampling and recruitment strategies to study hard-to-reach populations, with an emphasis on online and network-based methods. I expect to graduate in June 2025.

### Research Interests

My research tackles pressing challenges in demography, such as surveying populations without a sampling frame and addressing the limitations of traditional data collection methods. I am particularly interested in:  

- Online recruitment and social media surveys  
- Network-based sampling (e.g., respondent-driven sampling)  
- Health and social outcomes among vulnerable populations 
- Applications of LLMs in survey research
