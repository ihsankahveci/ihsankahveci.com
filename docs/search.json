My work focuses on developing novel sampling and recruitment strategies to study hard-to-reach populations, with an emphasis on online and network-based methods. I expect to graduate in June 2025.\n\n\nResearch Interests\nMy research tackles pressing challenges in demography, such as surveying populations without a sampling frame and addressing the limitations of traditional data collection methods. I am particularly interested in:\n\nOnline recruitment and social media surveys\n\nNetwork-based sampling (e.g., respondent-driven sampling)\n\nHealth and social outcomes among vulnerable populations\nApplications of LLMs in survey research"
