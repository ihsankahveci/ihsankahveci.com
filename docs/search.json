My work focuses on developing innovative sampling and recruitment strategies to study hard-to-reach populations, such as people experiencing homelessness, people who use drugs, and refugees. By integrating online tools and network-based methods, I tackle key challenges in data collection, including declining response rates, selection bias, and the lack of traditional sampling frames.\nI expect to graduate in June 2025 and am currently exploring opportunities to contribute my expertise in survey methodology, public health, and computational social science. My goal is to advance these fields through interdisciplinary research that bridges academic theory and practical application, whether in academia, industry, or the public sector.\n\n\nResearch Interests\nMy research addresses critical challenges in survey methodology and demographic data collection, with a focus on improving inclusivity and data quality. Specifically, I am interested in:\n\nCreating innovative strategies and methods to improve the data quality and representativeness of online surveys. This includes exploring alternative recruitment techniques, addressing biases in sampling, and leveraging platform-specific tools to engage underrepresented populations.\n\nAdvancing network-based sampling methods, such as respondent-driven sampling, to study hidden and marginalized populations. My work focuses on improving implementation by automating recruitment, addressing logistical challenges, reducing biases in population estimates.\nExamining the social and health disparities faced by vulnerable groups, including people experiencing homelessness and those affected by substance use disorders.\n\nExploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) to transform survey research through dynamic question generation, adaptive design, and open-ended response analysis."
